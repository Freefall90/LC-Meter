# LC-Meter
Hardware design files for an inductance and capacitance meter

The STLs are exports from the STEP file. The other folders contain STEP files for the external components (a switch and the LCD).

There's also a very unfinished plated through hole version of the board (the PTH variant). I started on that before I figured out the problem with the weird oscillations and never finished it since the SMD board works fine with the added cap.
